More Character Simulation

Thoughts
-  We only talked about "Fast and Flexible Multilegged Locomotion Using Learned Centroidal Dynamics" 
- The centroidal dynamics part basically meant modelling the character (at a very coarse level) as a simple inverted pendulum. Using this relatively simple model as a baseline that their controller can attempt to follow under simulation (while the details were quite complex), was a pretty elegant idea and lead to good results. 
- Their treatment of jumping and walking on un-even terrain was handled well, as the leg movement was adjusted appropriately to maintain certain speeds while taking physically realistic gaits. 
- I think I need to read the paper to really understand the details of their motion planner, though.
