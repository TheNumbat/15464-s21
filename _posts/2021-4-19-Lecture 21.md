Thoughts
- Frequency domain smoke guiding: while not especially physically motivated, this technique seemed quite useful for art directing smoke simulations - the ability to prototype in a low resolution (and hence real time) regime and have results actually translate to a higher resolution seems very useful. The differences in discretization are quite apparent when doing this without the guiding model, but with it the results are quite impressive, looking like simply more complex versions of the same phenomenon. 
- I thought the AnisoMPM paper was very interesting, although we didn't dig too deeply into the math behind MPM. Their anisotropic damage models gave quite realistic results, however, as damage and deformations always followed lines of weaker material.
