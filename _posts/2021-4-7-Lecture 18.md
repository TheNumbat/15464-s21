More fluids.

Thoughts
- Most of the papers here were further optimizations of the basic Eulerian methods to better preserve energy and detail, as well as making fluid simulations faster.
- I thought the PIC and FLIP methods were particularly interesting, as they combined the strengths of Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations by computing pressure and forces on a grid, but switching back to a particle based representation for advection. This allowed the non-linear advection term to correctly collect into new cells instead of some strange approximations seen last time.
- Same thoughts about SPH as last time - it seems like the more flexible method overall, as it can be integrated with other types of simulation (rigid body, soft body, etc.), upgraded to do things like simulate snow and the material point method.
